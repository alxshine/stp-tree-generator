\chapter{Background}
\section{Existing alternatives}
As of writing this paper, only very few tools support monitoring of STP topologies.
The ones we found are LoriotPro\cite{LoriotPro}, LiveAction\cite{LiveAction} and L2Discover\cite{L2Discover}.
Only the source code for L2Discover is openly available, the other two are proprietary software.
The company SolarWinds has an open vote on their website on whether or not to include this feature in the future since 2014\cite{thwackSW}.
LoriotPro and L2Discover use the SNMP for their topology discovery.
STP is only used to discover unused and duplicate links.
The Generator described in this paper uses only STP, thus not needing SNMP capable devices.
