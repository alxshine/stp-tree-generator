\chapter{Introduction}
As networks grow larger and more complex, redundancy becomes desirable and necessary.
With layer 2 (the data link layer in the OSI model, where we have MAC addresses but no IP addresses) redundancy also brings loops and the danger of so called Broadcast Storms (where broadcast messages are bounced back and forth between network nodes).
To this end the Spannning Tree Protocol\cite{perlman85} was created.
Note that the only layer 2 hardware considered in this paper will be Switches, as Hubs are not STP capable and also very rarely used in larger networks.
We will also refer to Switches as Bridges, in order to be compliant with the STP nomenclature\\
The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) works by creating a logical topology (in the form of a tree) over the physical topology by disabling specific ports.
An example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stp_example}

As the networks STP is used in are complex to start with, and as changes and outages are not immediately (if ever) noticed, it can be difficult to keep tabs on the current network layout.
While possible, surveying the results of the STP algorithm via the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) - which many business-grade Bridges are capable of - is tedious and requires the administrator to connect to every single Switch in the Local Area Network (LAN).
The aim of this project and the resulting STP-Tree-Generator (referred to in this paper as the Generator) is to decrease the complexity and workload that this task requires.\\

It achieves this goal by collecting STP packets at different locations in the LAN and then piecing them together at a central server.
The resulting report can then be downloaded from the server.
As of the time of writing this paper, the only output format available is the \LaTeX\ library TikZ.
